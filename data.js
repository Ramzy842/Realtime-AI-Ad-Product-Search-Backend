                Comes with a 2 year personal written warranty. This amp has less than an hour total lifetime usage. It has been in a central air low humidity environment without being used. It is A1 Mint with zero wear. The electronics are like factory new. You will never have an issue with this guaranteed. You can be sure that if you have any problem its the old patch cord you may be using and not this amp! I just never had the time to play with this as I focused on piano instead.

            "ad_creative_body": `"Mate."

The word echoed through my mind like a thunderclap. My steps faltered as I searched frantically for the source of that incredible smell—vanilla and jasmine with an underlying sweetness that made my mouth water. My wolf was practically clawing at my chest, demanding I find her immediately.

Then I saw her.

Grace Matthew. The packhouse keeper's daughter. The same girl I'd been tormenting since we were kids, the nerdy little mouse who jumped at her own shadow. She was hunched over her locker, dark hair falling like a curtain around her face as she fumbled with her books.

"No. No, this can't be right."

My wolf didn't care about my protests. He was already pushing forward, wanting to claim what was ours. But I fought him back, disgust warring with the undeniable pull I felt toward her. Grace Matthew—the girl who wore oversized sweaters, thick-rimmed glasses, and had never spoken above a whisper in her entire life. The girl who made an easy target because she never fought back.

"Jace? You okay?" Amber's voice seemed to come from far away. Amber pressed herself against my arm. Her blonde hair cascaded over her shoulders, and her low-cut top left little to the imagination. She'd been one of my regular hookups for months now.

I blinked, realizing I'd been staring at Grace for far too long. My friends had noticed too, following my gaze with confusion and then cruel amusement.
"Oh, look who's caught Storm's attention," sneered Marcus, one of my closest friends and the Beta's son. "Little Grace Matthew. What's wrong, Jace? Run out of real women?"

The group erupted in laughter, but I barely heard them. Grace had turned at the sound of her name, those wide brown eyes meeting mine for just a moment before she quickly looked away, cheeks flushing red. Even that brief contact sent electricity through my system.

"She doesn't know," I realized. At seventeen, she wouldn't be able to scent her mate yet. That ability didn't manifest until eighteen, and her birthday wasn't for another few months. The thought should have been a relief, but instead it made something twist in my chest.

"Earth to Jace," Amber said, snapping her fingers in front of my face. "Since when do you care about that little freak?"

The word 'freak' applied to my mate—even if she was an unwanted one—made my wolf snarl. Before I could stop myself, I was walking toward Grace's locker, my friends following like a pack of hyenas scenting blood.

"Well, well," I drawled, leaning against the locker next to hers. "If it isn't Grace the Mouse."

She flinched at my voice, clutching her textbooks tighter against her chest. The scent of her fear mixed with that intoxicating mate smell, and I had to clench my fists to keep from reaching for her.

"P-please, I'm not bothering anyone," she whispered, not meeting my eyes.

"You're bothering me just by existing," I said, the words tasting like ash in my mouth. But I couldn't stop. If my friends suspected there was anything different about how I saw Grace, if they sensed the mate bond... "Did you even shower this morning? You smell."

It was a lie. She smelled like heaven. But Grace's face crumpled at the words, and she pressed herself smaller against her locker.

"I... I did shower," she said quietly, and the hurt in her voice made my chest ache.

"Could've fooled me," Marcus added, and the others laughed.

Grace slammed her locker shut and tried to hurry past us, but I stepped into her path. The moment was brief—maybe two seconds—but when she bumped into my chest, the mate bond flared so intensely that I nearly screamed aloud. Her eyes flew up to mine, wide and startled, and for a moment I forgot to breathe.
Then reality crashed back, and I shoved her backward with enough force that she stumbled.
"Watch where you're going, freak," I snarled, hating myself with every word.

Grace didn't respond. She just gathered her scattered books and fled down the hallway, her long hair hiding her face. I watched her go, my wolf howling in protest at letting our mate escape.

"Jace," Amber said, sliding her arm through mine again. "You really hate that girl, don't you?"

I forced a cruel smile. "Can you blame me? She's pathetic."

But as we walked away, all I could think about was the brief moment when Grace had looked up at me—the way her eyes had widened, the soft gasp that had escaped her lips. My mate. Mine to protect, mine to cherish.

Mine to destroy, apparently.

Grace's POV

I ran to the bathroom, my heart hammering against my ribs as I locked myself in the furthest stall. The tears I'd been holding back finally spilled over, hot and shameful against my cheeks.

"Why did he have to be so cruel?"

Jace Storm had been my tormentor for as long as I could remember, but something about this morning felt different. Worse. When I'd bumped into him—God, I was so clumsy—there had been something in his eyes that I'd never seen before. Something that made my stomach flutter in the most confusing way.

Which was ridiculous. Jace Storm was everything I wasn't—confident, popular, devastatingly handsome. He was the future Alpha, destined to lead our pack, while I was just the keeper's daughter. We existed in completely different worlds, and he made sure I never forgot it.
I pulled off my glasses and wiped them clean, trying to compose myself. The bathroom door opened, and I heard the click of heels against the tile floor.

"Did you see the way he looked at her?" It was Amber's voice, high and gossipy. "I swear, for a second there, I thought Jace was going to—"

"Going to what?" another girl interrupted. "He can barely stand to be in the same room as Grace Matthew. Did you see how he shoved her? I thought she was going to cry right there in the hallway."
"She probably did cry, knowing her," Amber said with a laugh. "God, can you imagine being that pathetic? No wonder she doesn't have any friends."

I pressed my hand over my mouth, trying not to make a sound. They were right, of course. I didn't have any friends. The few attempts I'd made over the years had been crushed by Jace and his crew's relentless bullying. Who wanted to be friends with the girl everyone made fun of?

"I don't know," the other girl continued. "Sometimes I almost feel bad for her. She's always alone, and her mom died when she was little..."

"Don't waste your sympathy," Amber said dismissively. "Some people are just born to be losers. At least she knows her place."

Their voices faded as they left the bathroom, but their words echoed in my head. "Some people are just born to be losers." Maybe she was right. Maybe this was just my life—hiding in bathroom stalls, jumping at shadows, being too scared to speak up for myself.

But when I closed my eyes, I could still feel the warmth of Jace's body when I'd bumped into him, could still see that strange look that had flickered across his face for just a moment. It had almost looked like... but no. That was impossible.

Jace Storm would never look at someone like me with anything but disgust.

I gathered my courage and headed to first period, keeping my head down and hoping to make it through another day invisible. Just seven more months until I turned eighteen. Seven more months until I could finally scent my mate and maybe, just maybe, find someone who would see me as more than just Grace the Mouse.

Someone who might actually want me.

I had no idea that the Moon Goddess had already chosen—and that my mate was the very person who made my life a trouble.

Chapter 2

Grace's POV
The funeral pyre crackled against the grey October sky, sending sparks dancing into the wind like fallen stars. I stood at the edge of the gathered pack, watching the flames consume the only family I had left. My father's body lay beside my stepmother Elena's, both wrapped in the traditional white burial shrouds of our kind.
I should have been crying. Everyone expected me to cry. But there were no tears left—I'd cried them all three days ago when Alpha Storm had knocked on our door with that terrible look on his face.

"Rogue attack on the eastern border. Your father died protecting the pack. Elena died trying to protect him."

The words had shattered something inside me, something that might never heal. Dad had been everything to me after Mom died when I was seven. And Elena, who'd married him five years ago, had tried so hard to be a mother to the awkward, broken girl I'd become. Now they were both gone, and I was completely alone.

"Grace." Alpha Storm's deep voice startled me from my thoughts. I looked up to find him standing beside me, his expression grave. Behind him, I caught a glimpse of Jace's dark hair, but I quickly looked away. Even at my parents' funeral, I couldn't bear to meet his eyes.

"The pack house is available to you," Alpha Storm continued. "You're still part of our pack family. We take care of our own."

I nodded mutely, but I knew I couldn't stay there. The pack house held too many memories—Dad teaching me to fight in the training room, Elena braiding my hair in the kitchen, the three of us watching movies in the common area. Besides, I'd seen the looks from the other pack members. Pity mixed with relief that it wasn't their family. I couldn't live under that weight.

"Thank you, Alpha," I whispered. "But I... I think I'd like to stay in the cottage. If that's okay."

The cottage was a small, run-down place on the edge of pack territory that had been empty for years. Dad used to take me there sometimes when I was little, before it fell into disrepair. It felt right somehow—isolated, forgotten, just like me.

Alpha Storm's brow furrowed with concern. "Grace, that place hasn't been lived in for years. It's not safe for a young woman alone, especially so close to the border where—"

"Please." The word came out stronger than I intended, surprising us both. "I need... I need to be alone right now."

He studied my face for a long moment, then nodded slowly. "Very well. But I want weekly check-ins. And if you need anything—anything at all—you come to me immediately. Understood?"

I nodded again, then turned back to watch the flames consume what was left of my old life. Behind me, I heard the Alpha walk away, but I sensed someone else approaching. The scent hit me first—pine and leather and something dark that made my wolf whimper in confusion.

"Well, well," Jace's voice was low and mocking. "The orphan finally gets what she deserves."

I spun around, shock and pain warring in my chest. "What?"

He stood there in his black funeral suit, hands in his pockets, that cruel smile playing at his lips. But something was different about his eyes—they looked almost... hungry.

"You heard me," he said, stepping closer. "Maybe now you'll finally learn your place. No daddy to protect you anymore. No family to hide behind."

The words hit me like physical blows. "How can you say that? They just died. They died protecting this pack—protecting your family—"

"And now they're dead," he said with brutal simplicity. "Which means you're nothing. Less than nothing. A burden this pack shouldn't have to carry."

I stared at him, unable to process such cruelty. Even for Jace, this was beyond anything he'd done before. "I don't understand why you hate me so much," I whispered.

Something flickered across his face—too fast for me to identify. Then the mask was back, cold and merciless.

"Because you're weak," he said. "Because you don't belong here. Because every time I look at you, I see everything that's wrong with this pack."
I couldn't take anymore. I turned and ran, leaving behind the funeral, the pack, and Jace's words that seemed to burn worse than the funeral pyre.

Jace's POV

I watched Grace flee into the woods, my wolf clawing at my chest in fury. "What is wrong with you?" he snarled. "Our mate just lost her parents and you—"

I cut him off, slamming mental barriers down so hard it made my head throb. But I couldn't block out the image of Grace's face—the way her already pale skin had gone white as bone, the way her hands had trembled when I'd spoken.

"Cruel. You were cruel to our mate when she needed comfort."

I ignored my wolf and stalked back toward the pack house, but my father's hand on my shoulder stopped me.

"What was that?" Alpha Storm's voice was low and dangerous.

"What was what?" I tried to sound indifferent, but my father's eyes saw too much.

"That girl just lost her parents, and you chose that moment to torment her? Have I raised you to kick someone when they're down?"

"She needed to hear it," I said, the lie tasting bitter. "Someone had to tell her the truth."

"The truth?" My father's grip tightened. "The truth is that David Matthew died protecting this pack. That girl's father was one of our most loyal members, and his daughter deserves our respect and protection."

"She's weak," I insisted, hating how the words sounded even to my own ears. "She'll never be able to defend herself. She's a liability."

My father studied me for a long moment, and I forced myself to meet his gaze. Finally, he shook his head.

"I don't know what's gotten into you lately, son. But Grace Matthew is under this pack's protection, which means she's under my protection. If I hear about you harassing her again..."

He didn't finish the threat, but he didn't need to. I nodded curtly and walked away, my wolf howling in anguish with every step.

The truth was, I couldn't stop myself. Ever since that day in the hallway when I'd first scented her, something had been broken inside me. The mate bond pulled at me constantly, demanding I go to her, comfort her, claim her. But every time I saw her—small and fragile and everything an Alpha's mate shouldn't be—rage filled me instead.

She was supposed to be strong. She was supposed to be someone I could be proud to have by my side. Instead, she was Grace the Mouse, who jumped at shadows and couldn't even defend herself against high school bullies.

"Then make her stronger," my wolf suggested. "Protect her. Train her. Help her become who she's meant to be."

But I couldn't. The very thought of treating Grace with kindness, of letting anyone see that she meant something to me, made my skin crawl. I had a reputation to maintain. I was going to be Alpha of this pack, and that meant I needed a Luna who commanded respect, not pity.

Three weeks later, I found myself standing outside the old cottage where Grace had moved. I told myself I was just patrolling, just making sure the border was secure. But my wolf knew better.

The cottage looked even worse than I remembered—paint peeling from the walls, weeds growing wild in what used to be a garden. Through the single lit window, I could see Grace's silhouette moving around the small space. She looked thinner than before, if that was possible.

"She's not eating enough," my wolf observed with concern. "She's grieving. She needs—"

"She needs to learn to take care of herself," I muttered, but even I didn't believe it anymore.

I turned to leave, but the sound of breaking glass stopped me. Through the window, I saw Grace drop to her knees, gathering pieces of what looked like a broken picture frame. Her shoulders shook, and I realized she was finally crying—the tears that hadn't come at the funeral now falling freely in the privacy of her grief.

Every instinct I had screamed at me to go to her, to hold her, to promise that everything would be okay. Instead, I forced myself to walk away, leaving my mate alone with her pain.

Because admitting that I cared about Grace Matthew would mean admitting that the Moon Goddess had made a mistake. And I couldn't accept that.
Not yet.

Chapter 3

Grace's POV

The November wind cut through my thin jacket as I climbed the stone steps to Moonridge High, my backpack weighing heavy on my shoulders. Three weeks had passed since the funeral, and returning to school felt like walking into a nightmare I couldn't wake up from. Every face that looked at me held either pity or indifference, and I preferred the indifference.

I kept my head down, focusing on putting one foot in front of the other. The cottage had been lonely, but at least there I could grieve in peace. Here, surrounded by the chatter and laughter of my classmates, the silence inside me felt deafening.

"Well, look what crawled out of her hovel," Amber's voice cut through the morning air like a blade.

I stopped halfway up the steps, my hand tightening on the strap of my backpack. She stood at the top of the stairs with her usual group of followers, her blonde hair catching the weak sunlight. Behind her, I could see Jace leaning against the brick wall, watching with those dark eyes that seemed to see right through me.

"I heard you're living in that disgusting cottage now," Amber continued, her voice carrying across the courtyard. "What's next? Are you going to start howling at the moon like a real reject?"

A few students laughed, but most just watched with uncomfortable expressions. Even they knew this was wrong, but none of them would intervene. They never did.

"Please," I whispered, taking another step up. "I just want to go to class."

"Please," Amber mocked, her voice high and whiny. "That's all you ever say, isn't it? Please, please, please. No wonder your parents—"

"Don't." The word came out stronger than I intended, surprising us both. "Don't talk about them."

Amber's eyes glittered with malicious delight. "Oh, did I hit a nerve? Poor little orphan Grace. Tell me, do you miss mommy and daddy? Do you cry yourself to sleep in that pathetic little shack?"
Something inside me cracked. All the grief, all the pain, all the loneliness I'd been carrying crashed over me like a wave. "Stop," I said, my voice breaking. "Please, just stop."

"Make me," Amber sneered, taking a step toward the edge of the stairs.

I tried to back away, but my foot slipped on the stone step. For a moment, I teetered on the edge, my arms windmilling as I fought for balance. That's when Amber's hand shot out—not to help, but to push.

The world tilted sickeningly. I felt myself falling backward, the stone steps rushing up to meet me. My head struck the corner of a step with a sickening crack, and then I was tumbling, my body bouncing off the unforgiving stone until I finally came to rest in a crumpled heap.

Pain exploded through my skull, and I could feel something warm trickling down the side of my face. My vision blurred, and for a moment, I couldn't remember where I was or what had happened. The taste of copper filled my mouth.

"I need to call Dad," was my first coherent thought. "He'll come get me. He'll make it better."

I fumbled for my phone with shaking hands, my fingers slipping on the screen as I tried to dial his number. But then reality crashed back over me like ice water.

Dad was dead. Elena was dead. There was no one to call.

A sob escaped my throat, part pain and part devastating realization. I was completely, utterly alone.

Jace's POV

I watched Grace fall down the stairs as if in slow motion, each impact of her body against the stone sending shockwaves through the mate bond. My wolf roared in anguish, clawing at my chest as our mate's blood began to pool beneath her head.

"HELP HER!" he demanded. "OUR MATE IS HURT!"

But I stood frozen, watching as Grace reached for her phone with trembling hands. I could see the confusion in her eyes, the way she kept trying to dial a number before stopping, her face crumpling as she remembered.

She had no one to call. No one who would come for her.

"Oh," Marcus breathed beside me. "Amber really did it this time."

A crowd was gathering around Grace's still form, but no one moved to help her. They just stood there gawking like she was some kind of spectacle. The sight of my mate—bleeding and broken—should have sent me into a protective rage.

Instead, I laughed.

The sound came out harsh and cold, cutting through the shocked silence like a knife. Several people turned to stare at me in disbelief, but I couldn't stop. It was either laugh or completely lose control, and I couldn't afford to lose control.

"Serves her right," I heard myself say, the words like poison on my tongue. "Maybe now she'll learn to watch where she's going."

"MONSTER!" my wolf snarled. "What kind of mate are you? She's bleeding! She could be dying!"

But I pushed him down, buried him so deep that his howls became distant echoes. Because if I acknowledged what Grace meant to me—if I showed even a moment of concern—everyone would know. And I couldn't let that happen.

"You're sick," someone said behind me, and I turned to see my sister Mia standing there, her face white with fury. "That girl is hurt, possibly seriously, and you're laughing?"

"Mind your own business, Mia," I said, but there was something in her eyes that made me take a step back.

"Grace could have a concussion. She could have internal bleeding. And you're standing there laughing like it's the funniest thing you've ever seen." Mia's voice was deadly quiet. "What is wrong with you?"

Before I could respond, her fist connected with my jaw in a punch that would have dropped a normal human. The crack echoed across the courtyard, and I tasted blood as I staggered backward.

"Connor!" Mia shouted to one of the pack warriors who'd been watching the commotion. "Get Grace to the pack hospital. Now!"

Connor, a massive man with kind eyes, immediately moved toward Grace's crumpled form. He knelt beside her, carefully checking for spinal injuries before gently lifting her into his arms. Grace's head lolled against his shoulder, and I could see the blood matting her dark hair.
"It's okay, little one," Connor murmured as he carried her toward his truck. "We're going to take care of you."

The words hit me like another punch. "We're going to take care of you." But where was I? Where was her mate when she needed protection?

"I can't believe you're my brother," Mia said, her voice thick with disgust. "That girl has been through enough, and you... you're supposed to be the future Alpha. You're supposed to protect the members of this pack, not stand by and laugh while they bleed."

She turned and followed Connor, leaving me standing there with the taste of blood in my mouth and my wolf's anguished howls finally breaking through my defenses.

"You failed her," he whispered. "Our mate was hurt, and you failed her."

Chapter 4

Amber's POV

I pressed myself against the mahogany door of Alpha Storm's office, my enhanced hearing picking up every word of the heated conversation inside. I'd come to find Jace after the whole incident with Grace—honestly, I was expecting praise for finally putting that pathetic girl in her place. Instead, I'd found him getting the lecture of his life from his father.

"—completely unacceptable behavior!" Alpha Storm's voice boomed through the thick wood. "That girl could have died, Jace. She has a severe concussion and needed twelve stitches. And you stood there laughing?"

"She's fine," Jace's voice was defensive, but I could hear something underneath it. Something that made my stomach twist with unease. "It's not like I pushed her myself."

"No, but you might as well have! Amber is your... companion. Your actions reflect on this pack, on our family. What message does it send when the future Alpha shows no compassion for a grieving pack member?"

There was a long pause, and I leaned closer to the door.

"She's not just any pack member, is she?" Alpha Storm's voice had dropped to a deadly quiet. "I've been watching you, son. The way you seek her out to torment her. The way you can't seem to leave her alone. There's only one reason a young wolf behaves that way toward a female."
My blood ran cold. No. He couldn't mean...

"I don't know what you're talking about," Jace said, but his voice lacked conviction.

"Don't lie to me!" The Alpha's fist slammed against his desk, making me jump. "Grace Matthew is your mate, isn't she?"

The silence that followed was deafening. In that moment of quiet, my entire world shifted on its axis. Grace Matthew—quiet, pathetic, nobody Grace—was Jace's mate. The Moon Goddess had chosen that worthless girl over me.

"Answer me, Jace."

"Yes." The word was barely a whisper, but it hit me like a physical blow. "Yes, she's my mate. But I didn't ask for this. I didn't want—"

"Want?" Alpha Storm's voice was incredulous. "The Moon Goddess doesn't care what you want! She's given you a gift, and you've been treating it like a curse. That girl is going to be the Luna of this pack someday, and you've been—"

"She'll never be Luna," Jace interrupted, his voice hard. "I won't accept her. I can't. Look at her—she's weak, defenseless, nothing like what this pack needs."

"Then make her stronger! Help her become who she's meant to be! That's what a true mate does—they lift each other up, not tear each other down."

I'd heard enough. I slipped away from the door on silent feet, my mind racing with this new information. Jace Storm—future Alpha, the most eligible bachelor in the pack—was mated to Grace Matthew.

The injustice of it burned in my chest like acid. I'd been sleeping with him for months, had assumed I was being groomed to be his Luna. We were perfect together—both strong, both from good bloodlines, both everything this pack could want in leaders. But instead, the Moon Goddess had chosen some orphaned nobody.

Well, I wasn't going to stand for it.

By the time I reached my car, a plan was already forming in my mind. Jace had said it himself—he wouldn't accept Grace as his mate. All I had to do was make sure she was gone before her eighteenth birthday. Before she could scent the bond and make things complicated.

And I knew exactly how to do it.

Three Days Later.

I found Marcus in the pack training facility, working out his frustrations on a punching bag. Sweat glistened on his bare chest as he threw punch after devastating punch, but I could see the tension in his shoulders.

"Rough day?" I purred, sliding up beside him.

He paused mid-punch, glancing at me with those dark eyes that reminded me so much of Jace's. "What do you want, Amber?"

"Can't a girl just want to chat with a friend?" I batted my eyelashes innocently. "Besides, I heard about what happened at school. That must have been... difficult to watch."

Marcus's jaw tightened. "Grace got hurt. It wasn't exactly entertaining."

Interesting. Even Marcus, who usually followed Jace's lead in everything, seemed uncomfortable with how things had played out. That could work in my favor.

"Of course not," I said, laying a sympathetic hand on his arm. "Poor thing. Although, I have to say, I'm a little concerned about her... academic performance lately."

"What do you mean?"

I pulled out my phone, scrolling to a photo I'd taken of Grace's latest chemistry test. A photo I'd edited very carefully.

"I was helping Mr. Peterson organize papers yesterday, and I couldn't help but notice this." I showed him the screen, where Grace's grade showed a perfect score—too perfect. "Doesn't that seem suspicious to you? I mean, Grace has never been particularly brilliant, and suddenly she's getting perfect marks?"

Marcus frowned, studying the image. "You think she's cheating?"

"I don't want to think that," I said, injecting just the right amount of reluctance into my voice. "But look at this." I swiped to another doctored image—this one showing Grace's previous tests, all with failing grades. "The improvement is just so... dramatic. And I heard she's been staying after school a lot lately."

That part was true. Grace had been getting extra help from Mr. Peterson, trying to keep her grades up while coping with her grief. But Marcus didn't need to know that.

"If she is cheating..." Marcus said slowly.

"Academic dishonesty is grounds for expulsion," I finished. "And expelled students can't remain in pack territory. They're usually... relocated."

The euphemism hung between us. We both knew that "relocation" often meant banishment, especially for pack members with no family to vouch for them.

"But we'd need proof," Marcus said, though I could see the wheels turning in his head.

"Leave that to me," I said with a smile. "Grace's eighteenth birthday is in three months. If we're going to help her... see reason... about her future here, we need to act soon."

Marcus nodded slowly. "What do you need me to do?"

Two Weeks Later

Everything was falling into place perfectly. I'd been carefully planting evidence of Grace's supposed cheating—a few answers written in her handwriting on a test key hidden in her locker, some text messages between fake contacts discussing "the plan," even a few photographed study sessions that I'd doctored to look like she was copying someone else's work.

The beauty of it was that Grace was so isolated, so friendless, that no one would defend her when the accusations came. She had no allies, no one who would vouch for her character. Even the teachers who might have supported her would have to bow to the evidence.

I'd already approached Mr. Peterson with my "concerns," playing the part of the worried classmate who'd noticed some inconsistencies in Grace's work. He'd been reluctant to believe it at first—Grace was one of his most dedicated students—but the evidence was there.

"I just don't understand it," I'd told him, tears in my eyes. "Grace has been through so much with her parents' death. Maybe the pressure just got to her? I almost feel bad bringing this to your attention, but academic integrity is so important...

Now I just had to wait for the right moment to spring the trap. Grace's birthday was getting closer, and I needed her gone before she turned eighteen and complicated things for Jace.

My phone buzzed with a text from Marcus: "Peterson's planning to confront Grace tomorrow about the cheating allegations. You sure about this?"

I smiled as I typed back: "Trust me. This is for the good of the pack. Jace will thank us later."
And he would. Once Grace was gone, once that pathetic excuse for a mate bond was broken by distance and rejection, Jace would see clearly again. He'd realize that I was the one who'd always been there for him, the one who truly deserved to stand by his side.

The Moon Goddess might have made a mistake, but I was going to fix it.

After all, some people were just born to be losers. And Grace Matthew was about to learn that lesson the hard way.

Chapter 5

Grace's POV

The summons to the principal's office came during third period chemistry. Mrs. Henderson handed me the slip with a sympathetic look that made my stomach clench with dread. I'd barely been back at school for a week since my accident, and already something was wrong.

The walk to the administrative office felt endless. Students stared as I passed, and I caught fragments of whispered conversations that made my blood run cold.

"—heard she's been cheating for months—"

"—always knew there was something off about her grades—"

"—orphans will do anything to survive—"

By the time I reached Principal Davidson's office, my hands were shaking. He sat behind his desk with Mr. Peterson beside him, both wearing grave expressions. On the desk between them lay a manila folder that seemed to pulse with menace.

"Grace, please sit down," Principal Davidson said, his voice gentle but firm.

I perched on the edge of the chair, my backpack clutched against my chest like a shield. "Is something wrong? Did I do something?"

Mr. Peterson shifted uncomfortably. "Grace, I want you to know that this is very difficult for me. You've been one of my most dedicated students, especially since you started staying for extra help after your parents..."

He trailed off, and Principal Davidson picked up where he left off. "We've received some concerning allegations about academic dishonesty, Grace. Specifically, that you've been cheating on tests and assignments."

The words hit me like a physical blow. "What? No, I would never—"

"I understand this is shocking," Principal Davidson continued, opening the folder. "But we have some pretty substantial evidence."

He spread photographs across the desk—images of test papers with my handwriting, text messages between phone numbers I didn't recognize, and what looked like me copying from another student's work. My mouth fell open as I stared at the images.

"I don't understand," I whispered. "These aren't... I didn't... Where did these come from?"

"A concerned classmate brought these to our attention," Mr. Peterson said quietly. "Someone who was worried about you but felt obligated to report what they'd observed."
Amber. It had to be Amber. But how had she managed this? The photos looked real, but I knew I'd never cheated on anything in my life.

"Grace," Principal Davidson leaned forward, his expression serious. "Academic dishonesty is grounds for immediate suspension and possible expulsion. Given your... circumstances... this would also likely result in your removal from pack territory."

Banishment. They were talking about banishing me. For something I didn't do.

"Please," I said, my voice breaking. "I swear to you, I've never cheated. I study for hours every night. Ask Mr. Peterson—he knows how hard I work during our tutoring sessions."

Mr. Peterson's face was pained. "That's what makes this so difficult to understand, Grace. Your dedication seemed genuine, but the evidence..."

"Can I see my Alpha?" The words tumbled out before I could stop them. "Please, can I speak to Alpha Storm? He knew my father. He'll know I'm not lying."

Principal Davidson and Mr. Peterson exchanged glances. Finally, the principal nodded. "Given the severity of the allegations and their potential consequences, I think that's appropriate. We'll call him now."

Alpha Storm's POV

The call from Moonridge High came just as I was finishing a border patrol report. When Principal Davidson explained the situation, something cold settled in my stomach. Grace Matthew, caught cheating? The girl who'd spent every free moment studying since her parents' death? The girl who was my son's mate, whether he wanted to acknowledge it or not?

Something was very wrong here.

I arrived at the school within twenty minutes, my Alpha authority clearing the way to the principal's office immediately. Grace sat hunched in her chair, looking smaller and more fragile than ever. Her face was streaked with tears, and the scent of her fear and confusion filled the room.
"Alpha Storm," she whispered when she saw me, struggling to her feet.

"Sit, child," I said gently, taking the chair beside her. "Now, tell me what's happened."

Principal Davidson went through the allegations again, showing me the evidence. I studied each piece carefully, my wolf's instincts screaming that something was off. The photos were too convenient, too perfectly. And the timeline...
"When were these supposedly taken?" I asked.

"Over the past month," Mr. Peterson replied. "The concerned student said she'd been noticing inconsistencies for weeks."

I nodded slowly, filing that information away. "Grace, I want you to tell me, in your own words, exactly what you've been doing academically since returning to school."

Grace's voice was shaky but earnest as she described her study routine, her tutoring sessions with Mr. Peterson, her desperate attempts to keep her grades up while copling with grief. Every word rang with truth.

"And you've never, not once, cheated on any assignment or test?"

"Never," she said firmly, meeting my eyes. "My father always said that honor was more important than success. I would never dishonor his memory by cheating."

The mention of David Matthew hit me square in the chest. That man had been one of the most honorable wolves I'd ever known, and he'd raised his daughter with those same values.

"Principal Davidson," I said, standing. "I'm placing Grace Matthew under official pack protection pending a full investigation into these allegations."

"Alpha?" Grace looked up at me with confusion.

"Someone is trying very hard to destroy you, child," I said quietly. "And they've made a critical error—they've involved pack business. Academic dishonesty leading to banishment affects pack membership, which makes this my jurisdiction."

I turned to the principal. "I'll be conducting my own investigation. Until it's complete, Grace will not be returning to school, and no disciplinary action will be taken."

"But the evidence—"

"Can be fabricated," I said firmly. "I've seen enough frame jobs in my time to recognize one. Grace, gather your things. You're coming with me."

Later That Day - Alpha Storm's POV

I sat in my office with Connor, the pack's head of security, spread photographs and documents across my desk. Grace was safely ensconced in one of the pack house guest rooms under guard—not as a prisoner, but for her protection.

"What do you think?" I asked Connor.

The older warrior studied the evidence with experienced eyes. "The photos are good, but not perfect. See this shadow here? And the lighting in this one doesn't match the others. Someone with decent photo editing skills could have managed this."

"And the timeline coincides with when Amber began spending more time around the school after hours," I mused.

Connor nodded grimly. "I took the liberty of asking around. Seems Miss Amber has been very vocal lately about her... expectations regarding her future position in the pack."

"What kind of expectations?"

"The kind where she's already picking out Luna ceremonies," Connor said dryly. "She's been telling people that you and Jace are just waiting for the right moment to make it official."

I felt my wolf stir with anger. "Has she now?"

"There's more." Connor pulled out his phone. "I have a contact at the phone company. Those numbers in the supposed text conversations? They're all burner phones, purchased with cash three weeks ago. Want to guess what store they were bought from?"

"Surprise me."

"Electronics Plus. The same store where Amber works part-time."

The pieces were falling into place, and the picture they formed made my blood boil. Amber wasn't just trying to eliminate competition—she was trying to destroy an innocent girl to secure a position she had no right to.

"Connor, I want you to dig deeper. Find me everything—purchase records, photo metadata, witness statements. I want enough evidence to bury whoever's behind this."

"And if it is Amber?"
I thought about Grace's tear-streaked face, about the way she'd invoked her father's memory. Then I thought about my son, and how his rejection of his mate was poisoning him from the inside.

"If it's Amber, she's about to learn that there are consequences for attacking members of my pack. Especially ones under my protection."

Connor grinned, showing teeth. "Understood, Alpha."

As he left to begin his investigation, I picked up my phone to call Jace. It was time my son learned exactly what kind of woman he'd been associating with. And more importantly, it was time he learned what it meant to protect what was his—whether he wanted to admit it or not.

Because if Amber thought she could scheme her way into becoming Luna of this pack, she was about to discover just how wrong she was.

Grace's POV

I sat in the pack house guest room, staring out the window at the forest beyond. Alpha Storm had been kind but firm—I was to stay here until the investigation was complete. For my safety, he'd said.

Part of me was grateful for his protection. But another part wondered if this was just delaying the inevitable. If Amber had managed to fabricate evidence this convincing, what was to stop her from doing it again?

A soft knock at the door interrupted my thoughts. "Come in," I called.

To my surprise, it was Mia who walked in, carrying a tray of food and wearing a determined expression.

"Thought you might be hungry," she said, setting the tray on the small table by the window. "And I wanted you to know—not everyone believes those lies about you."

I looked up at her with surprise. "You don't?"

"Grace, I've seen how hard you study. I've seen how much you care about doing things right. The idea that you'd cheat?" Mia shook her head. "It's ridiculous."

For the first time in days, I felt a small spark of hope. Maybe I wasn't as alone as I thought.

"Thank you," I whispered.
Mia squeezed my shoulder gently. "My father will get to the truth. And when he does, whoever did this is going to regret it."

As she left, I allowed myself to believe, just for a moment, that maybe things would be okay. That maybe Alpha Storm would find the truth and clear my name.

I had no idea that the web of lies surrounding me was about to unravel in ways that would change everything.`,
